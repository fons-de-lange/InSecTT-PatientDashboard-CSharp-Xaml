desc: HID SEOS sample code for SmartCardAPI + CardModule.SEOS.dll

requirements:
HID SEOS card
Visual Studio 2013 or later
OMNIKEY smart card reader: 5023, 5127, 5427 

This sample code reads raw PACS bit data from HID SEOS cards. 
It also shows how to extract facility and card numbers applying public card formats.

Note that there is a ready-to-use utility - PACSprobe - available online at https://pacsprobe.com
This utility also uses SmartCardAPI + CardModule.SEOS.dll 

Please contact support@smartcard-api.com with any questions.
