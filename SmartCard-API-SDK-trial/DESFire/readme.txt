sample code: DESFire

This sample code shows how to access NXP DESFire EV1/EV2 cards using CardWerk's SmartCardAPI (professional)
It is not a full implementation of DESFire card edge. It implements big part of DESFire EV1 functionality though
and therefore we make it available to you.

Usage:
- load project in VS2013 or later
- connect PCSC compatible contactless card reader
- use blank DESFire EV1 card

The sample code will create a test application and then show a simple read/write cycle to access card data.

It can also format a card. However that requires code modification (set bool formatCard = true to allow formatting)

The latest version of this code is avaiilable at https://smartcard-api.com

Please contact support@smartcard-api.com with any questions.

Note, that we can provide similar libraries for Java, Python, C++ if need be (custom software development project)
